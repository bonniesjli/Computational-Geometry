# Visibility Algorithms
A serie of visibility algorithms using ray casting techniques in JavaScript I wrote during the math mentorship program at the University of Toronto. 

## Focus
Linear Flow algorithm visualizing the visibility on a torus.

## Ideas for Future Work
Solve the art gallery problem on surfaces of higher genus.
